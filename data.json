The idea of language is as coding for the human brain is very central to the plot."

Computing aspects include naming, code reuse, clever hacks, and a fairly deep exploration of what the author calls shell programming, but I would term development toolchains i.e. using a computer to program itself. Other aspects are well handled – how would you use a display of magic with no direct practical application, to gain power in a medieval setting? Also broaches the topic of (spoiler) <span style=\"color:white\">gender bias in tech</span>, though (spoiler++) <span style=\"color:white\">you wouldn’t think it until the end</span>. I would classify as young adult reading (no slur on my part – I like the concise nature of YA)."

At first a wonderous look at what the future might bring us (grounded in reality, focusing on ideas like augmented reality, computational currencies, and influencers; published nearly 15 years ago!) that becomes a terrifying look at what automation will mean for issues like terrorism (including a hard look at what computer privacy focused movements will have to contend with in the future). While the plot leaves somethings to be desired, the book is startingly evocative of a the near computational future."
